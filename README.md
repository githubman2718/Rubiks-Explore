# rubiks_solver

Supports the creation and manipulation of generalized rubiks cubes. Cubes may be of arbitrary length and spacial dimension.
No graphic interface is curruntly availiable, but there are plans to create one. The 2x2x2 cube solver and related methods are
curruntly nonfunctional due to github's limitation on filesize (they depend on a "large" database of positions), but a fix is
in the works.

Create a cube by instantiating the "Cube" class.

Class Cube(length=3, dim=3)

Then manipulate the cube with the available methods. Additional documentation is in the works.
