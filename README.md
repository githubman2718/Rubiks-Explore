# rubiks_solver

Supports the creation and manipulation of generalized rubiks cubes. Cubes may be of arbitrary length and spacial dimension.
No graphic interface is availiable: The cubes are represented as matrices. The 2x2x2 cube solver and related methods are
curruntly nonfunctional due to github's limitation on file size (these methods depend on a "large" database of positions), but
a fix is in the works.

Create a cube by instantiating the "Cube" class.

Class Cube(length=3, dim=3)

Then manipulate the cube with the available methods. Additional documentation is in the works.
