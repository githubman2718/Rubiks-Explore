# rubiks_solver

Supports the creation and manipulation of generalized rubiks cubes. Cubes may be of arbitrary length and spacial dimension.
No graphic interface is availiable: The cubes are represented as matrices. This project will require two cube datasets which are available for download at: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ef93m1riegor6i4/AABFlgJUDizUUU3jGxL69o-Da?dl=0

Create a cube by instantiating the "Cube" class.

Class Cube(length=3, dim=3)

Then manipulate the cube with the available methods. Additional documentation is in the works.
